# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

As a recent graduate of a rigorous full-stack coding bootcamp, I'm thrilled to dive into the world of web development. With a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I'm ready to tackle the exciting challenges ahead. Collaborative projects during my bootcamp taught me the value of clean code and efficient development practices, skills I'm eager to apply in real-world scenarios. My attention to detail ensures that I deliver high-quality work, and I'm committed to continual growth as a developer.

What sets me apart is my passion for creating user-friendly and visually appealing applications. I love crafting intuitive interfaces that enhance the user experience and make a real impact. I'm excited to bring this creativity and technical skill to the table, collaborating with experienced developers to tackle innovative projects and learn from their expertise.

Nestled in the breathtaking wilderness of Stanley, Idaho, I find inspiration in exploring the great outdoors. Whether it's hiking through rugged terrain with my dog or navigating local rivers' rapids, adventure fuels my spirit. As an active member of my community, I volunteer as an EMT, contributing to the well-being of those around me. When I'm not coding, you'll find me amidst the stunning Sawtooth Mountains, indulging in my passions for whitewater rafting, woodworking, and playing guitar.

I'm eager to bring my enthusiasm, technical skills, and love for learning to a dynamic development team. Ready to embrace new challenges and collaborate on innovative solutions, I'm excited to embark on this journey in the ever-evolving world of technology.
